# sngrep [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/irontec/sngrep.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/irontec/sngrep)

sngrep is a tool for displaying SIP calls message flows from terminal.

It supports live capture to display realtime SIP packets and can also be used
as PCAP viewer.

### Building from sources
Prerequisites

 - libncurses5 - for UI, windows, panels.
 - libpcap - for capturing packets.
 - libssl - (optional) for TLS transport decrypt using OpenSSL and libcrypt
 - gnutls - (optional) for TLS transport decrypt using GnuTLS and libgcrypt
 - libncursesw5 - (optional) for UI, windows, panels (wide-character support)
 - libpcre - (optional) for Perl Compatible regular expressions
 - zlib - (optional) for gzip compressed pcap files

On most systems the commands to build will be the standard autotools procedure:

    ./bootstrap.sh
	./configure
	make
	make install (as root)

You can pass following flags to ./configure to enable some features

| configure flag | Feature |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| `--with-openssl` | Adds OpenSSL support to parse TLS captured messages (req. libssl)  |
| `--with-gnutls` | Adds GnuTLS support to parse TLS captured messages (req. gnutls)  |
| `--with-pcre`|  Adds Perl Compatible regular expressions support in regexp fields |
| `--with-zlib`|  Enable zlib to support gzip compressed pcap files |
| `--enable-unicode`   | Adds Ncurses UTF-8/Unicode support (req. libncursesw5) |
| `--enable-ipv6`   | Enable IPv6 packet capture support. |
| `--enable-eep`   | Enable EEP packet send/receive support. |

You can find [detailed instructions for some distributions](https://github.com/irontec/sngrep/wiki/Building) on wiki.

## Usage

See `--help` for a list of available flags and their syntax

For example, sngrep can be used to view SIP packets from a pcap file, also applying filters

    sngrep -I file.pcap host 192.168.1.1 and port 5060

or live capturing, saving packets to a new file

	sngrep -d eth0 -O save.pcap port 5060 and udp


## Configuration

You can configure some options using [sngreprc](https://github.com/irontec/sngrep/wiki/Configuration) file
